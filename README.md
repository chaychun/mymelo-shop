# My Melody Shop

A simple shopping cart project based on [this video tutorial](https://youtu.be/HQFeTj0dGBo) by Dave Gray. It's meant for learning how to use TypeScript together with React, but I've also learned a good deal of CSS (Tailwind) and UI libraries (shadcn and others).

Note that this thing has many logic bugs, usability problems, and visual artifacts from my poor responsive design attempt. These will not be fixed any time soon, as I'm moving on to something else. It's nowhere near perfect, but it's a good learning experience.
